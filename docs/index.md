## Summary
Jarvis is an end-to-end question answering system designed as a chatbot in Minecraft to handle all the questions that you have about the game, using Minecraft wikipedia as its domain. It integrates an information retrieval system and BERT - a pre-trained, language representation model by Google that can be used for various NLP tasks. Upon being asked a question, Jarvis retrieves the most relevant webpage from its corpus, highlights the text that it thinks is the answer, and returns that to the user in Minecraft.
